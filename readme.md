## Introduction
In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a Recurrent Neural Network that can learn song lyrics and their melodies and then given a melody and a few words to start with, predict the rest of the song. This is essentially done by generating new words for the song and attempting to be as “close” as possible to the original lyrics. However, this is quite subjective leading the evaluation of generated words to use imaginative methods. For the training phase, however, we used Crossed Entropy loss.
The melody files and lyrics for each song were given to us and the train / test sets were predefined. 20% of the training data was used as a validation set in order to track our progress between training iterations.

We implemented this using an LSTM network. LSTMs have proven in the past to be successful in similar tasks because of their ability to remember previous data, which in our case is relevant because each lyric depends on the words (and melody) that preceded it.
The network receives as input a sequence of lyrics and predicts the next word to appear. The length of this sequence greatly affects the network’s predicting abilities since 5 words in a row work much better than just a single word. We tried using different values to see how this changes the accuracy of the model. During the training phase, sequences from the actual lyrics are fed into the network to train. After fitting the model, we can generate the lyrics for a whole song by beginning with an initial “seed” which is a sequence of words, predicting a word and then using it to advance the sequence like a moving window.

## Instructions
1. Please download the following:
	* A .zip file containing all the MIDI files of the participating songs
	* the .csv file with all the lyrics of the of the participating songs (600 train and 5 test)
	* [Pretty_Midi](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/craffel/pretty-midi/blob/master/Tutorial.ipynb) , a python library for the analysis of MIDI files

2. Implement a recurrent neural net (LSTM or GRU) to carry out the task described in the introduction.
	* During each step of the training phase, your architecture will receive as input one word of the lyrics. Words are to represented using the Word2Vec representation that can be found online (300 entries per term, as learned in class).
	* The task of the network is to predict the next word of the song’s lyrics. Please see the figure 1 for an illustration. You may use any loss function
	* In addition to this textual information, you need to include information extracted from the MIDI file. The method for implementing this requirement is entirely up to your consideration. Figure 1 shows one of the more simplistic options – inserting the entire melody representation at each step.
	* Note that your mechanism for selecting the next word should not be deterministic (i.e., always select the word with the highest probability) but rather be sampling-based. The likelihood of a term to be selected by the sampling should be proportional to its probability.
	* You may add whatever additions you want to the architecture (e.g., regularization, attention, teacher forcing)
	* You may create a validation set. The manner of splitting (and all related decisions) are up to you.

3. The Pretty_Midi package offers multiple options for analyzing .mid files.
Figures 2-4 demonstrate the types of information that can be gathered.

4. You can add whatever other information you consider relevant to further improve the performance of your model.

5. You are to evaluate two approaches for integrating the melody information into your model. The two approaches don’t have to be completely different (one can build upon the other, for example), but please refrain from making only miniature changes.

6. Please include the following information in your report regarding the training phase:
	*	The chosen architecture of your model
	*	A clear description of your approach(s) for integrating the melody information together with the lyrics
	*	TensorBoard graphs showing the training and validation loss of your model.

7. Please include the following information in your report regarding the test phase:
	*	For each of the melodies in the test set, produce the outputs (lyrics) for each of the two architectural variants you developed. The input should be the melody and the initial word of the output lyrics. Include all generated lyrics in your submission.
	*	For each melody, repeat the process described above three times, with different words (the same words should be used for all melodies).
	*	Attempt to analyze the effect of the selection of the first word and/or melody on the generated lyrics.

## Dataset Analysis

- Song lyrics features:
	- The length of a song is the number of words in the lyrics that are also present in the word2vec data.
		- For the training set:
		- Minimal song length: 3 words (Perhaps a hip hop song with lots of slang)
		- Maximal song length: 1338
		- Average song length: 257.37
	- For the test set:
		- Minimal song length: 94 words
		- Maximal song length: 389

You need to put files in two folders: input_files and midi_files, the other folders are generated automatically.
Inside input_files put the glove 6B 300d file and the training and testing set:

## Code Design

Our code consists of three scripts:

1. Experiment.py - the script that runs the experiments to find the optimal parameters for our LSTM network.
2. Data_loader.py - Loads the midi files, the lyrics, fixes irregularities and cleans the song file names, loads the word embeddings file, saves and loads the various .pkl files.
3. Prepare_data.py - Performs various helper functions on the data such as splitting it properly, creating a validation set and creating the word embeddings matrix.
4. Compute_score.py - Because of the nature of this task, it is difficult to judge the successfulness of our model based on classic loss functions such as MSE. So this script contains several different methods to automatically score the output of our model, such as measuring the cosine similarity or the subjectivity of the lyrics. Explained more later.
5. Extract_melodies_features - Extracts the features we want from the midi files and splits them into train / test / validation. Explained more later.
6. Lstm_lyrics.py - The first LSTM model. This one only takes into account the lyrics of the song. This is used for comparison to see the improvement of using melodies.
7. Lstm_melodies_lyrics.py - The second LSTM model. This one incorporates the features of the midi files of each song. More on this later.

## Melody Feature Integration
We devised two different methods to extract features from the melodies. One of them a more naive technique, and the other a more sophisticated way that expands the first method.

**Method #1**: Each midi file contains a list of all instruments used in the file. For each instrument, an Instrument object contains a list of all time periods this instrument was used, the pitch used (the note)  and velocity (how strong the note was played) as you can see in figure 1.


![](https://github.com/nevoit/Lyric-Generation-Recurrent-Neural-Network/blob/master/figures/6.PNG?raw=true)

Figure 1: The data available for each instrument of the midi file

The midi file contains the length of the melody, and we know the number of words in the lyrics, so we can easily approximate how many seconds lasts each word on average. Based on this, we assign each word a time span and can deduce what instruments were played during that word and how strong. If a word appears during times 15.2 - 15.8, we can search through the instrument objects for which ones appeared during that time frame. 

Using this data, we can compute how many instruments were used, their average pitch and average velocity per word. This provides the network some information about the nature of the song during this lyric, i.e. a low or high pitch and how high the velocity is.

In addition, we can easily use the function get_beats()  of pretty midi to find all the beat changes in the song and their times. We simply count the number of beat changes during the word’s time frame and thus add another feature for our network.

**Method #2**: With the first method we have the average pitch used for each word. Now, we want a more precise measurement of this. Each pretty midi object has a function getPianoRoll(fs) which returns a matrix that represents the notes used in the midi file on a near continuous time scale (See figure 1). Specifically, it returns an array of size 128\*S where the size of S equals the length of the song (i.e the time of the last note played) multiplied by how many times each second a sample is taken, denoted by the parameter fs. E.g, for fs=10 every 1/10ths of a second a sample will be made, meaning 10 samples per second so for a song of 120 seconds we will have 1200 samples. Thus getPianoRoll(fs=10) will return a matrix of size 128x1200. By this method, we can control the granularity of the data with ease.


![](https://github.com/nevoit/Lyric-Generation-Recurrent-Neural-Network/blob/master/figures/7.PNG?raw=true)

Figure 2: Piano roll matrix. The value in each cell is the velocity summed across instruments.

The reason for the 128 is that musical pitch has a possible range of 0 to 127. So each column in this matrix represents the notes played during this sample (in our example, the notes played every 100 milliseconds).

After creating this matrix, we can calculate how many notes are played, on average, per word. For example, if there are 2000 columns and a song has 50 words, it means that each word in the lyrics can be connected to about 40 notes. This is not precise of course, but a useful approximation.

![](https://github.com/nevoit/Lyric-Generation-Recurrent-Neural-Network/blob/master/figures/8.PNG?raw=true)

Figure 3: Notes played during a specific word in a song. Here each lyric received 40 notes representing it (columns 10-39 not shown). There are still 128 rows for each possible note.

We then iterate over every word in the song’s lyrics and find the notes that were played during that particular lyric. For example, in Figure 3 we can see that for a certain word, notes number 57, 64 and 69 were played. 

![](https://github.com/nevoit/Lyric-Generation-Recurrent-Neural-Network/blob/master/figures/9.PNG?raw=true)
Figure 4: The sum of the notes played during a specific word.

Finally, for each lyric-specific matrix, we sum each row to easily see what notes were played and how much. In figure 4, we can see the result of summing the matrix presented in figure 3. This is fed together with the array of word embeddings of each word in the sequence, thus attaching melody features to word features.

## Architecture
We used a fairly standard approach to a bidirectional LSTM network, with the addition of allowing it to receive as input both an embedding vector and the melody features. We also created an LSTM network that doesn’t receive melodies just to study the impact of melody on the results.

Number of layers: Both versions receive as input a sequence of lyrics. Then there is an embedding layer after the input that uses the word2vec dictionary to convert each word to the appropriate vector representing it. The difference between the networks is that the one using the melodies has a concatenating layer that appends the vectors of lyrics to the vector of melodies.

Additionally, we tried feeding the network various sequence lengths: 1, 5 and 10. We wanted to see how much the sequence length affects the results.

In addition to the piano roll matrix we keep the features extracted in method 1.

![](https://github.com/nevoit/Lyric-Generation-Recurrent-Neural-Network/blob/master/figures/10.PNG?raw=true)


- Layers 3 & 4 are only for the model that uses the melody features.
- Since RNNs have to receive input of fixed length, we use masking to ensure that the input is the same size each time.
- We simply concatenate all of the features and feed it into the LSTM to utilize the melody features. However, the features entered vary greatly between our two approaches.
- We used a relatively high drop rate of 60% since we don’t want the network to converge too quickly and overfit on the training data. We tried lower values initially and found more success with 60%.
- The input of the final layer depends on the number of units in the Bidirectional LSTM.
- The final output is a probability for each word, and we sample one from there according to the distribution.

**Stopping criteria:**
Here we also experimented with several parameters: We used the EarlyStopping function monitoring on the validation loss with a minimum delta of 0.1 (Minimum change in the monitored quantity to qualify as an improvement, i.e. an absolute change of less than min_delta, will count as no improvement.) and patience of 0 (Number of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped). We experimented with several values and found the most success with these.

**Network Hyper-Parameters Tuning:**
NOTE: Here we explain the reasons behind the choices of the parameters. 
After implementing our RNN, we optimized the different parameters used. Some parameters, like the number of units in an LSTM, it is very hard to predict what will work best so this method is the best way to find good values to use.
Each combination takes a long time to train (5-15 minutes):

- Learning Rate: We tried different values, ranging from 0.1 to 0.00001. After running numerous experiments, we found 0.00001 to work the best.
- Epochs: We tried epochs of 5, 10 and 150. We found 10 to work the best.
- Batch size: We tried 32 and 2048. 32 worked better.
- Units in LSTM: 64 and 256
- We tried all of the possible combinations of the parameters detailed above which led to a huge number of experiments but led to us finding the optimal settings which were used in the section below.

## Results Evaluation
In this assignment, we were asked to generate lyrics for the 5 songs in the test set. One way to evaluate the results is simply to see how many cases did our model predict the word that was actually used in the song. However, this is not actually a good method to evaluate the model since if it generated a word that was incredibly similar to it simple accuracy wouldn’t detect that. Note that we let our model predict the exact same number of words as in the original song. We devised a few methods to judge our models lyrical capabilities:

1. **Cosine Similarity**: this is a general method to compare the similarity of two vectors. So if our model predicted “happy”, and the original lyrics had the word “smile”, we take the vector of each word from the embedding matrix and calculate the cosine similarity, 1 being the best and 0 the worst. There are a few variations for this however:
	2. Comparing each word predicted to the word in the song - the most straightforward method. If a song has 200 words we will perform 200 comparisons according to the index of each word.
	3. Creating n-grams of the lyrics, calculating the average of each n-gram and then comparing the n-grams according to their order. This method is a bit better in our opinion, since if the model predicted words (“A”, “B”) and they appeared as (“B”, “A”) in the song, an n-gram style similarity will determine that this was a good prediction while a unigram style won’t.  So we tried with 1, 2, 3 and 5-grams.
4. **Polarity**: Using the TextBlob package, we computed the polarity of the generated lyrics and the original ones. Polarity is a score ranging from -1 to 1, -1 representing a negative sentence and 1 representing a positive one. We checked if the lyrics carry the same feelings and themes more or less. We present in the results the absolute difference between them, meaning that a polarity difference of 0 means the lyrics have similar sentiments.
5. **Subjectivity**: Again drawing from TextBlob, subjectivity is a measure of how subjective a sentence is, 0 being very objective and 1 being very subjective. We calculate the absolute difference between the generated lyrics and the original lyrics.

Note: In the final section where we predict song lyrics, we tried with different seeds as requested. With a sequence length of S, we take the first S words (i.e, words #1, #2, ..#S) and predict the rest of the song. We then skip the first S words and take words S+1 until 2S. Then we skip the first 2S words and use words 2S+1 until 3S. 
Example with Sequence Length of 3:
Seed 1, seed 2 and seed 3 -

## Full Experimental Setup
Validation Set: Empirically, we learned that using a validation set is better than not if there isn’t enough data. We used the fairly standard 80/20 ratio between training and validation which worked well.

- Batch sizes - 32
- Epochs - 5
- Learning rate: 0.01
- Min delta for improvement: 0.1
- 256 units in the LSTM layer

Additionally, we tried feeding the network various sequence lengths of 1 and 5 to study the effect on the quality of the results.

**Experimental Results:**
The best results are in bold -

![](https://github.com/nevoit/Lyric-Generation-Recurrent-Neural-Network/blob/master/figures/13.PNG?raw=true)

**Analysis**: unlike our expectations, the model with simpler features worked better in almost all cases, perhaps due to Occam’s Razor. We theorize that the features about the instruments provided a good abstraction of the features of the entire piano roll. 
However, it is clear that adding some melody features to the model improved it on all parameters (except subjectivity). Additionally, having a sequence length of 5 has mixed results and doesn’t seem to have much of an impact on the evaluation methods we chose. We will look into this manually in the next section.

An interesting point is that for all cosine similarity evaluations, an increased n gave a higher similarity. We are not sure why this happens, but we think that with greater values of n the “average” word is more similar. We tested the cosine similarity where n={length of song}, and indeed the similarity was over 0.9. We then tested with a random choice of words and all of the words in a song (i.e., the average vector of the whole song), and the cosine similarity was a staggering 0.75. 

**Generated Lyrics:**
For Brevity’s sake we’ll only show both models with a sequence of 1 and the advanced model with a sequence of 5.

## Analysis of how the Seed and Melody Effects the Generated Lyrics

We see that the lyrics are mostly unintelligible, and tend to have words that are very common in the data set (the word “love” appears over 40 times in the generated lyrics and it is indeed a common lyric in popular songs). It doesn’t appear that more advanced melody features improved the subjective quality of the lyrics produced, like how our quantitative methods deemed that it doesn’t improve much. We did notice however a peculiar feature, where once a word appeared for the first time, it tended to appear many times after (or similar variations of it, e.g. if “i” appeared then “i”, “me” or “my” tend to appear after it a lot”). This is to be expected from a model that maintains a cell state and predicts words based on their embedding.

Also it’s apparent that the seed chosen wildly changes the words produced. We think this is because the melody plays a much smaller part in predicting the lyrics compared to the seed, so even with the same melody the dominating factor in producing the lyrics is the seed - see our evaluation table above; the results are slightly better with the melody attached, but not by much, meaning that the first word assists the model much more compared to, say, a baseline of a random word each time. 

Personally, we don’t see much of an improvement in using 5 words as a seed versus just the first word. Occasionally it leads to better combinations but it’s a hit-or-miss usually. We think this is because of 2 main reasons:
Many songs contain slang that isn’t in the word embedding matrix so we cannot learn from them or predict them
Many song lyrics aren’t completely coherent and the words are fairly independent of each other (for a good example see the original lyrics of the last song in the test set, “All the Small Things” by Blink 182).
